Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app. Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.


The Navigation component consists of three key parts that are described below:

    * Navigation graph: An XML resource that contains all navigation-related information in one centralized location. This includes all of the individual content areas within your app, called destinations, as well as the possible paths that a user can take through your app.
    * NavHost: An empty container that displays destinations from your navigation graph. The Navigation component contains a default NavHost implementation, NavHostFragment, that displays fragment destinations.
    * NavController: An object that manages app navigation within a NavHost. The NavController orchestrates the swapping of destination content in the NavHost as users move throughout your app.

As you navigate through your app, you tell the NavController that you want to navigate either along a specific path in your navigation graph or directly to a specific destination. The NavController then shows the appropriate destination in the NavHost.



onbackPress::::if want some action on backpress of fragment then use this code::


        // This callback will only be called when MyFragment is at least Started.
        OnBackPressedCallback callback = new OnBackPressedCallback(true /* enabled by default */) {
            @Override
            public void handleOnBackPressed() {
                Toasty.success(getActivity(),"BAck",Toasty.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        };
        requireActivity().getOnBackPressedDispatcher().addCallback(getActivity(), callback);
